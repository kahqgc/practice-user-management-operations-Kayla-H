# practice-user-management-operations-Kayla-H
practice 1:
In this exercise, I practiced using core SQL operations including INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT statements on a users table. The most challenging part was managing duplicate entries and understanding how updates and deletions affect multiple rows when they share the same keyword like username.

practice 2:
In this exercise, I created customers and orders tables, then ran some queries to analyze customer spending and order data. It includes grouping, filtering, joins (inner and left), subqueries, and aggregate functions to extract data like total spending per customer, orders over a certain amount, and guest purchases.
